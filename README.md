Overview

This project is an advanced Cisco Packet Tracer topology that models full connectivity 
from multiple local access networks (Home, SMB, and Train) to a Tier-3 ISP backbone. 
It demonstrates real-world integration of fiber, DSL, and cable last-mile systems through enterprise-class routing and switching hardware. 
The network consists of over 21 interconnected devices, including an ISR4331 enterprise router, 819HGW industrial router, multilayer switch  
and a custom fiber repeater, configured across both logical and physical topologies.




Technical Scope

The prototype emphasizes Layer 1 and Layer 2 architecture, focusing on realistic cabling (copper, fiber, coaxial, and phone line) and media conversion. 
Each LAN segment is equipped with dedicated switches and gateways, while the Tier-3 domain handles ISP aggregation and distribution through VLAN-ready multilayer switching. 
Wireless SSIDs are configured per network for segmented mobile access, and NVRAM persistence ensures all interface activations are retained after reboots. 
Logical and physical layouts are fully synchronized, including building-level organization that mirrors actual carrier deployment.
